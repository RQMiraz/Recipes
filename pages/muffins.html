        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dutch-processed cocoa powder gives 
            these high altitude double chocolate 
            muffins their rich color and flavor, 
            and sour cream keeps them deliciously 
            soft, tender and moist. Dark chocolate 
            chips add an extra hit of chocolate in 
            every bite!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup full-fat sour cream</li>
            <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>¾ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup unsweetened, Dutch-processed cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 ½ tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ tsp coarse Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 218 C, and position a rack in the center of the oven. Line a standard-sized muffin pan with 14 paper liners, and lightly spray the paper liners with non-stick baking spray.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the sour cream, milk, oil, sugar, eggs and vanilla until smooth.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt and 3/4 cup of the chocolate chips.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and use a spatula to stir the batter together just until moistened, being careful not to over-mix.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter between the muffin cups, filling them full. Sprinkle the top of the batter with the remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>When you put the muffins in the oven, immediately turn the heat down from 218 to 190. Bake for about 18-20 minutes, just until a toothpick comes out clean or with moist crumbs clinging to it. Be careful not to over-bake the muffins, or they can dry out.</li>
            <li>Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool for about 10 more minutes. Enjoy the muffins warm.</li>
